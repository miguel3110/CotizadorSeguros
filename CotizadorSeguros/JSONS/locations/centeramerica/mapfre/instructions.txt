for this insurance plan. the way to calculate the price is the following

the price will change Depending on the age of the client and how many people are added 
into the plan and their ages
THERE IS only one deudctable for this plan that is 500

if a client is 30 years old his price will be 91.95.

if that same client wants to add his spouse into the plan and the spouse is 25 years old 
the price will be 91.95 + 77.56 = 169.51
if you go to the json you can se that the price for a deductable of 500 for a member of the plan

if that same client wants to add his spouse of 25 years old and a dependent of 60 years old then the prince will be
91.95 + 77.56 + 237.62 = 407.13

if that same client also wants to include a dependent of 3 years old then his prince will be
91.95 + 77.56 + 237.62 + 65.68 = 472.81


REMEMBER THAT SPOUSE = PARTNER

Let me deconstruct the JSON for you

{
    "500": "117.64", //Deductable, fior this plan ther is 
                     //only one deductable and the price will change according to the age of the client
    "age": "44"  //The age
}
