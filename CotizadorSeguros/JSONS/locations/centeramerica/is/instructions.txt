for this insurance plan. the way to calculate the price is the following

the price will change Depending on the age of the client and how many people are added 
into the plan and their ages
THERE IS only one deudctable for this plan that is 300

if a client is 30 years old his price will be 93.

if that same client wants to add his spouse into the plan and the spouse is 25 years old 
the price will be 93 + 72.10 = 165.10
if you go to the json you can se that the price for a deductable of 300 for a member of the plan


if that same client also wants to include a 1 dependent  then his prince will be
93 + 72.10 + 66.10= 231.20

if that same client wants to include a 6 dependent it the price will be
93 + 72.10(spouse) + 317.30 (5 dependents) + 62.8 (the sixth dependent) = 545.20

so, they chare 62.8 for the sixth dependent, 62.8 for the seventh and so on


REMEMBER THAT SPOUSE = PARTNER

Let me deconstruct the JSON for you

    "300": "151.9", //Deductable, for this plan ther is 
                    //only one deductable and the price will change according to the age of the client
     "age": "47"
}
 spouse

                    //only one deductable and the price will change according to the age of the client
    "age": "26" 
}
