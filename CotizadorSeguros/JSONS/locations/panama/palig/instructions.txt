for this insurance plan. the way to calculate the price is the following

the price will change Depending on the age of the client and how many people are added 
into the plan. There is no dedectable

LUCKILY we dont have to worry about a DEDUCTABLE because all are 0

so if a client wants this plan, and has 40 years old he will pay
63

if that same client wants to add his spouse of 20 years old and two dependents then his price will be
63+32= 95

for every dependent added to the plan you just ad 26 to the price
If the client from before has include his 20 years old spouse and add 5 dependent to the plan the price will be
63+32+26+26+26+26+26=225

REMEMBER THAT SPOUSE = PARTNER

Let me deconstruct the JSON for you
{
    "alone": [
        {
            "0": "46", //The deudctable is 0 for all this plan and the price will be 46 
            "age": "34"
        }
    ],
    "spouse": [
        {
            "0":"36", // the deudctable is 0 fot this plan and the price if a spouse of 31 years old is added will be 36 more
            "age": "31"
        }
    ],
    "dependent 1": [
        {
            "0": "26"
        }
    ]
